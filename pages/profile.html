      <h2 class="headline">Full Stack Developer</h2>
      <p>Since I was a child, I have been inquisitive. Series like "Cosmos Carl Sagan" fulfilled my childhood. It is about the cosmos, stars, the beginning of life, black holes; in summary; it is about science. I was that kid who wanted to open all kinds of stuffâ€”small things like showers, calculators and telephones. I drove my parents nuts. But I wasn't alone, my father was an electrical engineer, and he taught me many things. So, you can imagine everything in my house was broken or missing pieces.</p> 
      <p>I always enjoyed exploring new learnings, wanted to grow, and after graduating as an engineer, I studied humanities. I finished my journey in my native country as an Agile Coach in banking.</p>
      <p>English always was a barrier in my career. So, my partner and I decided to study English overseas. We chose New Zealand because we enjoy the outdoors and it wasn't difficult to fall in love with New Zealand.</p>
      <p>So, we moved definitely to Aotearoa, and now I am looking for a career change. I am studying computing at Unitec, and I have found myself in love with programming languages, frontend, backend and mobile development.</p>

        <h2>Why me?</h2>
        <p>I am a goal hunter. I enjoy challenges. I am of a questioning nature and confident that anything is possible.</p>
        <p>I want to be part of the female community in the Information Technology area still dominated by men. I believe that women have a more careful look at software development. I believe that diversity, and the courage to explore, discover and learn, are the values that I look for within a company to continue my professional growth.</p>
