      <p>Since I was a child, I have been inquisitive. Series like "Cosmos Carl Sagan" fulfilled my childhood. It is about the cosmos, stars, the beginning of life, black holes; in summary; it is about science. I was that kid who wanted to open all kinds of stuff—small things like showers, calculators and telephones. I drove my parents nuts. But I wasn't alone, my father was an electrical engineer, and he taught me many things. So, you can imagine everything in my house was broken or missing pieces. 
        
        I always enjoyed exploring new learnings, wanted to grow, and after graduating as an engineer, I studied humanities.

I finished my journey as an Agile Coach in banking in my native country, Brazil. 
        
        English always was a barrier in my career. So, my partner and I decided to study English overseas. We chose New Zealand because we enjoy the outdoors and it wasn't difficult to fall in love with NZ. 
        
        So, we moved definitely to New Zealand, and now I am looking for a career change. I am studying computing at Unitec, and I have found myself in love with programming languages, frontend, backend and mobile development.</p>
