      <p>Since I was a child, I have been inquisitive. I was that kid who wanted to open all kinds of stuffâ€”small things like showers, calculators and telephones. I drove my parents nuts. But I wasn't alone, my father was a mechanical engineer, and he taught me many things. So, you can imagine everything in my house was broken or missing pieces.</p> 
      <p>I always enjoyed exploring new learnings, wanted to grow, and after graduating as an engineer, I studied humanities. I finished my journey in my native country as an Agile Coach in banking.</p>
      <p>English always was a barrier in my career. So, I decided to study English overseas. It wasn't difficult to fall in love with New Zealand. I love sports outdoors.</p>
      <p>Now, I am studying computer science, and I have found myself in love with programming languages, frontend, backend and mobile development.</p>
